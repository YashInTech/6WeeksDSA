## üìÖ Challenge Schedule
The challenge spans 6 weeks, with a focused plan for each week to ensure comprehensive learning. Each week will cover specific topics and problems, starting with basics and gradually moving to advanced concepts.

### Week 1: Arrays and Strings
- Learn array manipulation techniques.
- Solve problems on searching and sorting.
- Dive into string processing and pattern matching.

### Week 2: Linked Lists
- Understand singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.
- Solve problems on merging, reversing, and detecting cycles in linked lists.

### Week 3: Stacks and Queues
- Learn to implement stacks and queues using arrays and linked lists.
- Solve problems on parentheses matching, stock span, and sliding window.

### Week 4: Trees and Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
- Understand tree traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
- Solve problems on height, diameter, and balancing of trees.

### Week 5: Graphs
- Learn graph traversal techniques (BFS and DFS).
- Solve problems on shortest paths, connected components, and cycles in graphs.

### Week 6: Dynamic Programming and Recursion
- Master recursive problem-solving.
- Solve classic DP problems like knapsack, coin change, and longest common subsequence.
